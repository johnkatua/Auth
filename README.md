# Auth

The project is used to login user and register user. It helps you learn about user authentication using react-redux and node.js

## Built with

* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - I used redux to manage the state of the user when he login and register.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Used react to create the client side components for the best UI.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.js is used to create the API for the server side so that the user can successfully register and login.
